## Installation Guide üì∞

### Step 1: Install Chocolatey üç´

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that simplifies the installation of software.

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** with **Administrator** privileges.
2. Run the following command to install Chocolatey:

   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; 
   [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; 
   iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```

Or see  [Chocolatey official documentation]([https://link-url-here.org](https://chocolatey.org/install)).

3. Close and reopen PowerShell to refresh the environment variables.

### Step 2: Install Node.js üå≥

Node.js is required to run the JavaScript script that fetches the current ARB price.

1. In PowerShell, run the following command to install Node.js:

   ```bash
   choco install nodejs -y
   ```

2. After installation, verify Node.js is installed by checking the version:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Step 3: Install GCC üß¨

GCC is required to compile the C program.

1. Install GCC using Chocolatey:

   ```bash
   choco install mingw -y
   ```

2. Verify GCC installation:

   ```bash
   gcc --version
   ```

### Step 4: Clone or Download the ARB Count Project ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. Download the project files from the GitHub repository or clone it using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DOUINA-Mouhamed/arb_count.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd arb_count
   ```

### Step 5: Install Node.js Dependencies üßµ

1. Install `node-fetch`, a package required for fetching data from the CoinGecko API:

   ```bash
   npm install node-fetch
   ```

2. Ensure that the `fetchArbPrice.js` script is correctly set to use ES modules. Your `package.json` should include `"type": "module"`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "arb_count",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "type": "module",
     "dependencies": {
       "node-fetch": "^3.3.1"
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 6: Compile the C Program ‚òÑÔ∏è

1. Compile the C program using GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -o arb_count.exe arb_count.c
   ```

2. The executable `arb_count.exe` should now be in your project directory.

## Usage

The ARB Count tool can be used via command-line arguments. Below are examples of how to use the different functionalities:

### Display Help ü©π

To see the help message with details about available commands:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe -h
```

### Add a New Transaction üí∞

To add a new transaction to the specified file:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe -t transactions.txt
```

### Calculate Total Investment and ARB Holdings üìä

To calculate the total investment and ARB holdings from a transactions file:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe transactions.txt
```

### Calculate Profit/Loss üìà

To calculate potential profit or loss based on the current ARB price:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe -s transactions.txt
```

## Examples üñãÔ∏è

### Adding a Transaction üí∞

After executing the `-t` flag, you will be prompted to enter the transaction details:

```plaintext
Day (DD): 01
Month (MM): 08
Year (YYYY): 2024
EUR (00.00): 12.50
ARB (00.00): 25.00

Transaction added successfully.
```

### Calculating Total Investment üèõÔ∏è

Running the tool without any flags will give you a summary of your investments:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe transactions.txt
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Fetching current ARB price...
Current ARB value in EUR: 0.57956E
Total invested (tax included): 24.82E
Total Arbitrum in possession: 40.00ARB
```

### Calculating Profit/Loss üíπ

Using the `-s` flag will show your potential earnings or losses:

```bash
.\arb_count.exe -s transactions.txt
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Total invested (tax included): 24.82E
Total Arbitrum in possession: 40.00ARB
Current ARB value in EUR: 23.18E
Loss: -2.64E
```

## Explanation of Flags ‚òëÔ∏è

- **`-h`**: Display help information about the program and its usage.

## Notes üìî

- The program assumes the transactions file is formatted with lines containing dates, EUR amounts, and ARB amounts, separated by colons (e.g., `01/08/2024:12.50E:25.00ARB`).
- Ensure Node.js and GCC are properly installed and configured in your PATH to compile and execute the program.

## Troubleshooting ‚öîÔ∏è

- **Node.js Not Recognized**: If Node.js commands are not recognized, verify that Node.js is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- **API Rate Limiting**: The CoinGecko API has a rate limit; if you hit this limit, wait a few moments before trying again.
- **Permission Issues**: Run PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator if you encounter permission-related errors.
